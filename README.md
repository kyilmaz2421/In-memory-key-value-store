# Introduction 
 
I built this project as a year 2 Computer science student at McGill University in my Operating Systems class.

# How it works

I built my "kv store" with 500 pods.
My design is governed by the global variables set in "lib.h". I allocate TOTAL_SIZE (TOTAL SIZE is an int that represents the number of bytes allocated) in memory and structures it according to the following design.

I implement `500 pods` where  `(4 + 500(POD_SIZE)= TOTAL_SIZE`. The 4 bytes at the beginning is left for an integer that counts the number of readers currently reading from the kv_store (“readersCount”). The semaphores used this number when locking or releasing the RW lock. `POD_SIZE` is governed by this formula `(MAX_BUCKETS*(20+(KV_PAIR_COUNT(256+32)))) = POD_SIZE `.

`MAX_BUCKETS` is the number of buckets each pod has in order to account for collision, I currently have this set to 15. I ran another external program that tested the hash function for collision rate, the max number I got was 11 and therefore I am using 15 just to be safe.

Collision is accounted for by when a key is hashed we go to the pod that it points to and then for all the non NULL buckets we iterate through and `strcmp` the keys until there is a match. If all buckets have been filled and there is no match then it overwrites the 1st bucket.

`KV_PAIR_COUNT` is the number of blocks allocated per pod (per bucket) to write kv pairs 
each block is then comprised of 288 bytes (32 for key and 256 for value).

Note: The tester sets this number to 256 so I did this as well.


lastly for each bucket the 20 bytes are there for bookeeping purposes as described below:

1. The 1st set of 4 bytes: `numFreeLeft` determining how many blocks of `KV_PAIRS` in pod are free still and haven’t been written to, this initialized to `KV_PAIR_COUNT` up creation of the shared memory

2. The 2nd set of 4 bytes: `nextFree` determining the next free block in bucket the location that the next write will be to

3. The 3rd set of 4 bytes: `earliestEntry` used for FIFO this locates the earliest (or oldest ) write in the current bucket

4. The 4th set of 4 bytes: `nextRead` determining the next block to be read in pod, the location that the read will be from

5. The 5th set of 4 bytes: `keylength` (done to minimize usage of `strcmp` when testing for collison),
store the string length of the key so that when dealing with collision we limit the number of times `strcmp` is executed


Throughout the assignment I traverse through my shared memory using the `addr` (i.e `addr += 4` or `addr+= strlen(key)`) pointer that I retrieve when I map the space. I follow the above rules I have set out to ensure accurate reads and writes.

# Future Improvements
- Another way to use this would've been to utilize structs instead of just pushing the "pointers" manually
